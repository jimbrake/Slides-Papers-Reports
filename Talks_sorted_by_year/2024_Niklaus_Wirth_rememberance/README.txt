Abstract: 
Niklaus Wirth https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklaus_Wirth passed away early this year.  His legacy includes several programming languages, computer workstations and FPGA courseware.  Most of all he was an educator that developed programming languages, computer IDE/operating systems and soft microprocessors to educate his students.  Simplicity was his hallmark.

http://pascal.hansotten.com/niklaus-wirth/ has details on his many projects.  Join us as we relive the 60s through the 90s when programming languages evolved rapidly along with microprocessors and personal computers.  Those with related stories to tell are welcome to contact jim.brakefield@ieee.org for integration into the slide deck.
