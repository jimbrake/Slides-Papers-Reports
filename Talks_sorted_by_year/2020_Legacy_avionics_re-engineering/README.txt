Topic: Legacy Avionics Re-Engineering

Military aircraft have lifespans of over 50 years.  In that time electronics has advanced tremendously and many older parts are no longer in production.  Thus there is a need to replace outdated avionics with a replacement.  This offers some unique opportunities for the design of the replacement: Specifications are well established.  Additional features and better performance are welcome.

Remarks on how far electronics has advanced, the nature of avionics design and two case studies are presented.
