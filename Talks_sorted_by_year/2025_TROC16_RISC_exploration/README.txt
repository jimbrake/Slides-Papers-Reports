Abstract:

It is computer architecture of my design, of the RISC variety. It is an effort to achieve high code density, deterministic execution and a uniform base for diversity. The 16-bit instructions are now running on a FPGA board, with specifications for the 24 & 32-bit instructions written. The basic template is written and it is straightforward to add more instructions. 
That said, I would welcome help: do trade-off studies (resource utilization and performance) on each additional instruction.  Assembler, compiler and other help is very much needed. As a sneak preview, the architecture supports four data sizes and four data types.  Those interested can do experiments on: 
Different word sizes (16, 18, 24, 32, 36, 42 ...)
Different data types (unsigned, two's complement, sign & magnitude, IEEE 754, POSIT, PT-floats, 16-bit fixed point logarithms ...)
Different implementations (single cycle, pipelining, multiple issue, out-of-order â€¦ microarchitectures)
