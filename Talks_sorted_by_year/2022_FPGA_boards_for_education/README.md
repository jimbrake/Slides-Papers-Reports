### Topic: Economies of Scale for FPGA Education  

The simple idea is to do for FPGAs what Raspberry Pi and Arduino have done for microprocessor education: Reduce the cost of ownership by an order of magnitude.  Starting with a review the existing FPGA boards, their costs and capabilities.  Next, present the case for student ownership of the board.  And the software infrastruction available.  Lastly will present the chosen FPGA board, the available schematic capture and simulation tools, the conversion of schematic to RTL and the tool flow to place the design on the FPGA board.  

For economies of scale to be obtained, a low cost standard FPGA board is needed that can be adopted widely.
