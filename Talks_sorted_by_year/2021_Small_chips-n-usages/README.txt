Small Chips and Their Many Uses
Abstract:
Talk will cover what’s available in “tiny”, in many cases smaller than a cubic millimeter, integrated circuits and other related components.  First a review of the standard chip footprints along with actual samples.  Then will cover the notable, should I say fantastic devices in small form factors, which include almost every kind of chip.  MEMs devices have also shrunk.  Some new aspects of circuit board assembly: replacement of solder masks by ink-jet printing, digital tweezers and the USB microscope.  Lastly some comments on the number of transistors per square millimeter and the prospects for even smaller chips.
