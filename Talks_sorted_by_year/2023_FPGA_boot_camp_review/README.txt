Topic: Review and update on FPGA Boot Camp grant

After recieving a IEEE Computer Society grant for Inovative Technology, presented a talk on low cost FPGA boards last March.  Slides at: https://events.vtools.ieee.org/m/306653

IEEE Created a web page for the grant: https://tryengineering.org/tryengineering-community-resources/fpga_boot_camp-slides-flyer-and-spreadsheets/ which gives some idea of the goals of the grant.  Since then have conducted seven FPGA boot camps.

The current slides for the two day boot camp are at: https://github.com/jimbrake/FPGA_Boot_Camp

One of the goals was a $20 FPGA kit.  A web page on this at: https://github.com/jimbrake/20-dollar-FPGA-kit

The presentation will cover and update the above; and present plans for FPGA workshop(s).
