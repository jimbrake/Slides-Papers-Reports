## A $20 FPGA kit  
Pictures of each component on the web page, most FPGA boards are over $100
	One of the goals of the FPGA Boot Camp grant was a lowest cost FPGA kit.  
	Using a $14 FPGA board from China it is possible.  
      Ugh: tariffs and inflation have raised the FPGA board price to $23  
      Good news: available from Amazon  
	Gowin tools still early however Tang boards are getting noticed
