Jim Brakefield will attempt to give a balanced talk on computer floating-point arithmetic and his often cited patent  https://patents.google.com/patent/US5892697A/en  Method and apparatus for handling overflow and underflow in processing floating-point numbers:

Floating-point history and early issues

IEEE Standard 754, its goals and limitations

Motivation for Brakefieldâ€™s patent

Subsequent and current developments

Challenges are in the details or what can go wrong
