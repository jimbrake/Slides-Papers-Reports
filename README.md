# Slides Papers Reports
Am showing only what is publically available or on this github web site  
As there are about 100 of these, they are subdivided  
A given file may occur in more than one subdirectory  
The web page on each file will contain notes and retrospections  

Most of the files are now uploaded  
There are now 61 individual directories in Talks_sorted_by_year  
And eight category directories with spreadsheet lists  
Abstracts and commentary are not complete  
And there are several presentations that need to be located
