# Slides Papers Reports
Welcome to my presentation slide decks, papers and reports  
Vanity aside, I'd like to showcase my academic side  
And provide full copies for those that wish to reference my work  
Some are referenced without being full peer reviewed  

Am showing only what is publically available or on this github web site  
The web page on each file will contain notes, comments and retrospection  
About a dozen still need to be found and scanned  
And I'd like to writeup work not yet published  

Most of the files are now uploaded  
There are now 61 individual directories in Talks_sorted_by_year  
And eight category directories with spreadsheet lists  
Abstract, commentary and review on many are not complete
